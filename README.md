# Streamr Client (Unofficial)
By using this client, you can easily develop Python-based backend systems to interact with the Streamr API. You can, for example, subscribe to real-time data in Streams, produce new data to Streams, and create new Streams.

This library is work-in-progress based on the Javascript implementation which can be found here and doesn't provide wrapper functions for all the endpoints in the Streamr API.

Streamr Client implementation in Python is a work in progress. As such, there's a few things you can do right now to help out:


* **Take a look at the js streamr-client.** The idea is for this client to implment the same functions as the Javascript one. So go check that one out and get coding in python. 
* **Perform code reviews.** More eyes will help a) speed the project along b) ensure quality and c) reduce possible future bugs.
* **Add tests.** Tests, tests and I don't know if I have said this already but tests.
